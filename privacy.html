  <h1>Privacy Policy for Equation Quest</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Equation Quest ("we", "our", or "us") operates the mobile application
    <strong>Equation Quest</strong> (the "App") available on Android and iOS platforms.
    This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure
    of data when you use our App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users.
    However, the App uses third-party analytics services that may automatically
    collect certain data for diagnostic and performance purposes.
  </p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (such as model, operating system, version)</li>
    <li>App usage data (such as crash logs, performance data, and general usage trends)</li>
    <li>Anonymous identifiers to help us improve app stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The collected data is used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and fix app crashes or bugs</li>
    <li>Improve app performance and reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may use third-party services that collect, monitor, and analyze app usage to
    help improve performance. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
    <li>Apple Analytics (on iOS)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These services may collect data as governed by their own privacy policies.
    We encourage you to review their respective policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Diagnostic data such as crash logs are retained only as long as necessary to
    troubleshoot and enhance the App’s performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Equation Quest does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information
    from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided
    us with personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but please remember that
    no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.
